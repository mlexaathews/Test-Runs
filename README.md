Hey hi hello!
If you're reading this: congratulations! You've made it to my first Github repository!
I've named the repository "test-runs" just because these are products of my first time making plots, graphs, etc. 
The files still need to be cleaned up so try not to pay too much attention to the messiness/entropy.
Also, I'll try to sound more serious one day --maybe not anytime soon, but one day!
